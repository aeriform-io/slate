Faera is a simple and beautiful app for screen replacement vfx work. Providing elegant tools for typical device use cases on most acted scenes, with minimal design.

Faera can be set to blue and green screen colours for typical chroma keying tasks.

In addition, a light grey for typical device luminance for overlay compositing, or black for 'off' appearance, allowing reflection preserved tracking with visible markers.

A neutral grey is also available to assist with white balance.

Faera is designed to have minimal design feedback in order to reduce any necessary paint work in compositing.
