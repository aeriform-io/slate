# RAMMA
Ramma is post production support software for locating missing or corrupted frames of animation or video.

Render problems can happen for many reasons, often due to hardware or software failure, or human error but hunting down these problems in sequences can be a nightmare.

This is why Ramma exists.

Whether they be missing or dropped frames, corrupted or even non-contiguous frames that are given an incorrect numerical padding in the filename, Ramma quickly and automatically detects these common problems.

Intended for post production professionals—large facilities as well as smaller or indie shops—producing motion graphics, visual effects, colour grading or other video and animation work, working with Autodesk, Adobe, Foundry, Blackmagic Design, Maxon or any products that render to image sequences.

## Locating Frames and Sequences
## Ignoring Folders
Sequence folders on disk many be ignored to prevent them from being read by Ramma.

This is useful when sequences contain subfolders that are not intended to be read as sequences.

To set a folder to be ignored, click and hold `DISMISS` until `IGNORE` appears. Click this to commit.

Ramma will generate a `.ignore` file within the specified sequence folder.
<aside class="notice">To restore ignored folders, find and delete the .ignore file.</aside>
## Generating Reports
Ramma can generate a report of frames that are marked as bad.

This is useful for passing back a list of frames to rendering software, and some that may lack the ability to skip existing frames.
